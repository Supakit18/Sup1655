                                <li>
                                    Make the marinade. Combine coconut milk, soy sauce, lime juice, brown sugar, curry
                                    powder,
                                    ground
                                    coriander, ground ginger, minced garlic, sriracha and fish sauce in a bowl.

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Marinate the chicken. Add two pounds of cubed boneless, skinless chicken breasts to
                                    the
                                    marinade,
                                    toss
                                    the chicken in the marinade until it’s well coated. Place in the refrigerator to
                                    marinate
                                    for 30
                                    minutes.
                                    This chicken is honestly so flavorful and tender after just a 30 minute marinade,
                                    but if
                                    you
                                    want to
                                    make it
                                    earlier, you can leave the chicken in the marinade for up to 4 hours.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Skewer the chicken. If using wooden skewers, soak the skewers in water for 30
                                    minutes
                                    before
                                    preparing
                                    the skewers. This will prevent the skewers from catching fire on the grill, pretty
                                    important
                                    stuff!
                                    Remove
                                    the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinating liquid. Skewer 4-5 pieces
                                    of
                                    marinated
                                    chicken onto
                                    skewers. You’ll need 10-12 metal skewers or soaked wooden skewers.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Grill the chicken. Turn on a grill to high heat. Cooking these skewers quickly over
                                    high
                                    heat
                                    will give
                                    them a wonderful sear on the outside, while keeping them juicy and tender in the
                                    middle!
                                    Place
                                    the
                                    skewers
                                    on the grill over high heat for 3-4 minutes, flip and grill for an additional 3-4
                                    minutes.
                                    Remove
                                    from the
                                    grill and top with fresh cilantro, if you’d like.

                <blockquote>
                    – while this is optional, it’s also pretty standard to find chicken satay paired with peanut sauce.
                    They
                    really are a match made in heaven!
                </blockquote>
                <p> Lettuce Leaves</p>
                <blockquote>
                    - chicken satay is delicious served as a lettuce wrap. Simply use a fork to remove the chicken from
                    the
                    skewers and place it right in an iceberg, butter or romaine lettuce leaf. Drizzle with a little
                    peanut
                    sauce
                    and you’ve got a light, healthy meal!
                </blockquote>
                <p> Fresh Veggies</p>
                <blockquote>
                    – as I mentioned above, I served the chicken satay with a fresh veggie tray from Vons and extra Thai
                    peanut
                    sauce for dipping the veggies. The chicken and veggie combo was light, yet still filling enough for
                    a
                    meal
                    and it gave me the opportunity to dip two things into that absolutely delicious peanut sauce!
                </blockquote>
                <p>Stir Fried Veggies </p>
                <blockquote>
                    – while the chicken is marinating, you can take that time to stir fry up your favorite veggies, like
                    broccoli, bell peppers, onions and sugar snap peas.
                </blockquote>
                <p> Asian Salad</p>
                <blockquote>
                    – for an easy side, grab a bagged Asian chopped salad in the produce section at your local Vons, to
                    pair
                    with the chicken skewers. Cooked Rice or Quinoa – for a more filling side, serve the chicken satay
                    with
                    a
                    side of cooked white rice, brown rice or quinoa.
